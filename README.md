Please fork this repository if you want to contribute, then send a pull request.

Note the plurals in the heading. We would like several designs to be created here, not just one. Anyone can either contribute a new design or improve or correct an existing one.

Please put your work in one of these folders, as appropriate, or create a folder under which to put the tree of your own work:

 - Datasheets - useful commercial electronic or mechanical devices

 - Electronics - Kicad circuit designs

 - Experiments - Results of trials and experiments

 - Ideas - Thoughts and brainstorming results

 - Inspiration - Related projects and other online sources of useful information

 - Mechanics - Mechanical designs in FreeCAD

 - Pictures - Generally useful or interestinhg images

 - Software - Software for Arduino, ESP32 etc.


We would like to reserve the folder RepRapLtd for our own work, so we don't get confused...
