### Complete designs

1. Similar to SpaceMouse in design:
   - [Mighty Mouse](https://github.com/mattogodoy/mighty-mouse) by [Matias Godoy](https://github.com/mattogodoy). Identifies the device to the host as a USB mouse.
   - [Ahmsville dial v2](https://www.hackster.io/ahmsville/ahmsville-dial-v2-a38b17) 5 axis space navigator by [Ahmed Oyenuga](https://www.hackster.io/ahmsville). A compact and configurable design for joystick + MPU + encoder, with optional macro keypad. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGbshYLfDnc) here, and all design files and firmware are on [Ahmed's Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGbshYLfDnc) (different repositories).
   - [CAD-Mouse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:260830) by [Samuel Kranz](https://www.thingiverse.com/secures/designs) on Thingiverse. A 3D printed DIY joystick with a rotary encoder on top. Files can be found in [Samuel's Github repository](https://github.com/secures92/CADMouse), as well as the firmware for an Arduino HID device (ATMega32U4 ?) and custom Windows driver.
   - [tams_printed_ft](https://github.com/TAMS-Group/tams_printed_ft) - "Low-cost 3D printed force-torque sensors, including ROS drivers, CAD designs, and Arduino firmware.", accompanying a whitepaper in review. Includes a SpaceMouse inspired [OpenSCAD design](https://github.com/TAMS-Group/tams_printed_ft/blob/ec7108c025660944d1c6a2b25e328d470805007b/openscad/spacemouse-9904.scad).
1. Alternative designs
   - [HyperController](https://github.com/mnesarco/HyperController) by [Frank David Mart√≠nez](https://github.com/mnesarco). An 8D alternative design, utilizing a couple of thumb joysticks, a few buttons, and potentiometers. Parts combined in a relativley ergonomics layout on a raised armrest.
   - A basic single joystick + single encoder layout, using modifier keys to switch between joystick functions. [Githb repo](https://github.com/soemarko/DIY-Space-Mouse).

### POCs and experimental designs

- [Video](https://youtu.be/71BHSb0jeJg) and [Github repo](https://github.com/BKTRIE/DIY-3D-Mouse) by [BKTRIE](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7L7W9u7U4rhSDqpl6tWU_g) of a gyroscope based 3D input mouse. Device is a POC, rotates model by sending mouse commands over USB. Gyroscope is attached to a gooseneck USB lamp mechanically for stabilization, USB device is achieved with a Digispark (ATTiny85).

### Demos without further information

- Francesco Gennari's [Spacemouse 3D Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQtHlUEb58) video. No code or 3D models, just video.
- [6D (axsotic)](http://valentinheun.com/portfolio/6d/) by [Valentin Heun](http://valentinheun.com/). This looks like a trackball suspended in a cradle which lets the user interface with the ball from a different angle than usual. Seems to be a concept design.
