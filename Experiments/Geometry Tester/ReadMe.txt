This is a test script attached to a blender file which outputs the distance between a magnet and the sensors. This could be used to simulate designs.

While made in blender 2.82, the script may be able to be adapted to work with FreeCADs scripting too.

How to use:
- open the file in blender
- jump over to the scripting tab and make sure you have "geometryTestScript" selected.

- !update the filepath with one for your computer!

- hit the play button at the top of the pain
- The distances will update on every new frame of animation

TODO:
- Make distance have an R^2 fall off, like in real life.
- Use matplotlib to output a graph directly, rather than having to use excel on the CSV.
- Make it easier to adapt to new designs with different parts etc.
- Parent the parts together to make it easier to use.
